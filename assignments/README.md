# Homework Assignments

The folder contains three homework assignments to be solved by the students.

The files provide skeletons for the students to start from a common template
and solve their assignments. The skeletons also provide some submission requirements
such as the requirements on *axis titles*, *units*, *derivations*, etc. Please pay
attention to these requirements when finalizing your assignments.

## Platform

The assignments are provided in the form of [Jupyter][jupyter-link] notebook files
to encourage students to choose a free, interactive platform when solving their
assignments.

As of now, students are encouraged to use the [Julia][julia-link] language for
the kernel of the notebook files.

There two options to use the platform:

1.  **Local.** Install both the [Jupyter][jupyter-link] platform and the
    [Julia][julia-link] language on your system following the instructions on
    the web pages, or,
2.  **Cloud.** Use the freely available, online platform [JuliaBox][juliabox-link].

## How to Obtain Assignments

Depending on your choice of using the platform, there are different ways of obtaining
the assignments:

1.  **Local.** If you have chosen to install the platform locally on your computer,
  - **git.** Either you can use [git][git-link] to [clone][clone-doc], or,
  - **download.** Simply [download][dl-link],

  the [whole][repo-link] repository, or,
2.  **Cloud.** If you have chosen to use [JuliaBox][juliabox-link], simply **sync**
    the [repository][repo-link].

Note, however, that the **download** approach *might* require you to re-download
the repository at times to get any changes introduced.
