# Exercises

The folder contains exercises to be solved by the teaching assistant.

The files contain sample solutions for the selected problems. Some files *might*
also contain small numerical examples for illustration purposes.

## Platform

The exercises are provided in the form of [Jupyter][jupyter-link] notebook files
to for an interactive learning experience.

As of now, numerical examples are writtein in the [Julia][julia-link] language.

There two options to use the platform:

1.  **Local.** Install both the [Jupyter][jupyter-link] platform and the
    [Julia][julia-link] language on your system following the instructions on
    the web pages, or,
2.  **Cloud.** Use the freely available, online platform [JuliaBox][juliabox-link].

**Note.** You can also use [Jupyter nbviewer][nbviewer-link] to view the notebook
files online, without the ability to do any modification and/or run numerical examples.

## How to Obtain Exercises

Depending on your choice of using the platform, there are different ways of obtaining
the exercises:

1.  **Local.** If you have chosen to install the platform locally on your computer,
  - **git.** Either you can use [git][git-link] to [clone][clone-doc], or,
  - **download.** Simply [download][dl-link],

  the [whole][repo-link] repository, or,
2.  **Cloud.** If you have chosen to use [JuliaBox][juliabox-link], simply **sync**
    the [repository][repo-link].

Note, however, that the **download** approach *might* require you to re-download
the repository at times to get any changes introduced.
